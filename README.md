# Proof of Concepts

This is my personal sandbox where I explore, learn, and test various technologies and concepts. The goal is to dive deep into new tools, frameworks, and patterns by implementing small-scale projects and experiments.

## My Toolkit for Quick Exploration
The following tools are used for quick exploration and experimentationâ€”not intended for production:
- **Faker**: A Python library for generating fake data for testing purposes.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight relational database for fast prototyping.
- **DuckDB**: An in-process SQL OLAP database, optimized for analytical queries.


## Current Explorations

Right now, I'm focused on the following technologies:
- **Iceberg**: A high-performance table format for large analytic datasets, designed for high-volume data lakes.
- **Dagster**: A data orchestration platform that makes it easy to build, run, and monitor complex data pipelines.
- **DuckDB**: An in-process SQL OLAP database management system designed for fast analytical queries.
- **RisingWave**: A cloud-native streaming database for real-time applications, focusing on low-latency data processing.


## Why This Repo?
This repository serves as a collection of proof-of-concept implementations to:
- **Learn**: Understand the core concepts and best practices associated with each technology.
- **Test**: Experiment with different use cases and scenarios to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each tool.
- **Document**: Keep a record of findings, challenges, and solutions as a reference for future projects.
